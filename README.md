# Listening Experiment on Polyphonic Rhythm Complexity

This repository contains the audio files included in the listening test presented in the article: _"A Latent Rhythm Complexity Model for
Attribute-Controlled Drum Patterns Generation"_.

The audio clips were synthetized from MIDI files taken from [Goove MIDI Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/groove) using a library of realistic drum samples distributed with [Ableton Live 9 Lite](https://www.ableton.com/en/) at 120 bpm.
