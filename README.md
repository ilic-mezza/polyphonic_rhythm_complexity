# Listening Experiment on Polyphonic Rhythm Complexity

This repository contains the audio files included in the listening experiment presented in the article: _"Latent Rhythm Complexity Model for
Attribute-Controlled Drum Patterns Generation"_.

The audio files were synthetized from MIDI files were taken from Goove MIDI Dataset<https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/groove> using a library of realistic drum samples distributed with Ableton Live 9 Lite.
