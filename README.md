# Listening Experiment on Polyphonic Rhythm Complexity

This repository contains the audio files included in the listening test presented in the [article](https://rdcu.be/c5SsS): 

 > Alessandro Ilic Mezza, Massimiliano Zanoni, and Augusto Sarti, “A latent rhythm complexity model for attribute-controlled drum pattern generation,” EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing, vol. 2023, no. 1, pp. 1–14, Feb. 2023.

The audio clips were synthetized from MIDI files taken from [Goove MIDI Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/groove) using a library of realistic drum samples distributed with [Ableton Live 9 Lite](https://www.ableton.com/en/) at 120 bpm. All MIDI notes were quantized to the nearest sixteenth pulse, and velocity was uniformly set to 80.
